        <h2>Music Genres</h2>
        <h5>House music</h5>
        <p>House music emerged in the early 1980s in Chicago, evolving from disco and electronic influences. Pioneered by DJs like Frankie Knuckles, often called the "Godfather of House," house music is defined by its 4/4 beat structure, synthesized basslines, and soulful vocal samples. The genre quickly spread to New York and Europe, where subgenres like deep house, progressive house, and acid house flourished. House music is known for its uplifting energy, hypnotic rhythms, and ability to blend with other styles, making it a staple in clubs and electronic music festivals worldwide.</p>
        <h5>Rap Music</h5>
        <p>Rap music, a central element of hip-hop culture, originated in the Bronx, New York, during the 1970s, with pioneers like DJ Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash shaping its early sound. Characterized by rhythmic spoken lyrics, complex wordplay, and beats often sampled from funk and soul records, rap has evolved into a global phenomenon with diverse subgenres such as gangsta rap, conscious rap, and trap. The genre has expanded its influence beyond music, shaping fashion, language, and social movements, with artists like Tupac Shakur, Jay-Z, and Kendrick Lamar using rap as a medium for storytelling, activism, and self-expression.</p>
        <h5>Techno Music</h5>
        <p>Techno music was born in Detroit in the mid-1980s, pioneered by artists like Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson, known as the "Belleville Three." Unlike house music, which retains elements of funk and soul, techno focuses on futuristic and mechanical sounds, emphasizing driving beats, syncopated percussion, and layered synthesizers. The genre's minimalistic and hypnotic nature has led to variations like acid techno, industrial techno, and melodic techno. Techno's underground culture thrives in cities like Berlin, where clubs like Berghain have become legendary for their immersive, all-night dance experiences.</p>
